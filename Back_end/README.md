## Gameplay
  At the beginning of each turn, each of the regions belonging to the current player accrues
interest, and then the timer for that player resumes counting down. During this time, the player
can revise their construction plan. If the player is satisfied with the existing construction plan,
they can confirm it, at which point the timer pauses, and the city crew of that player embarks
from the city center, performing tasks according to the construction plan until finished. Then, the
next player's turn begins.
